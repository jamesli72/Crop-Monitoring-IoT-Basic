## An Immediate IoT Project For Student

## Learn how to build an IoT System with many sensors and actuators, create a basic web server and application to view the data
This project was upgraded when I was doing a project at the university, it is simple to learn and write some immediate code for an IoT application system.
Every part of this project is a sample code that shows how to do the following:

*Create a custom web server with traditional HTML, CSS, and JS.
*Create a simple monitor system with ESP32-CAM and DHT11
*Create a system based on Arduino Uno R3 with many features
*Learn how to communicate between Arduino and ESP32
*Create a basic app by using the MIT service
